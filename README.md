# Lab_03

This is the code from my 3rd lab in my Engineering Computation 1 class. There are 2 programs here: myprog.cc and mycat.cc
mycat.cc:
This program provides the same function as the "cat" unix command, which prints a file in the command line.

myprog.cc
This program just prints out the ASCII conversion table for decimal values 0 to 256 in a nice format
